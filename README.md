# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


# React
**React** is a declarative javascript library for building user interfaces. Provides ways to design UI and make it reactive to certain events. 
* **JSX** is a short hand way of writing out a tree of HTML elements which can be seen in the return statement of a function in react. Under the hood, react is using JSX and React elements to construct a virtual DOM.
* **DOM** is an abbreviation for Document Object Model. DOM refers to the underlying tree of HTML elements that make up a document. In order for react to update the real DOM that we see on a webpage, it has to build a new virtual DOM compared to the old one and update only the elements that have changed in actual DOM.
* **Declarative UI Framework:** React is referred as a declarative UI framework, meaning it has a level of abstraction between what you write in javascript and what is outputted to DOM.
* React uses ***components*** to build a UI. Component can be thought of a small piece of a larger UI made up of many different components put together.


## Optional Prerequisites

* Prettier can be installed in the VS code for code formatting whenever necessary.
* In settings, update the editor.formatOnSave setting to True in the JSON file.
* Eslint installed for JavaScript linting.



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
